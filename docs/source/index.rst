================
FEniCS in Docker
================

The easiest way to install `FEniCS <http://fenicsproject.org>`_ is to
use our prebuilt, high-performance Docker images.

This documentation explains how to get quickly started with using
FEniCS in Docker, as well as how to take advantage of more advanced
features of Docker.

On modern Linux systems there is no performance penalty when running
FEniCS in Docker, compared to running natively on the host system. On
other systems, such as Mac or Windows, running FEniCS in Docker may
actually be faster than using a native build since our Docker images
have been tuned for performance.

.. note:

   This documentation is under development.
