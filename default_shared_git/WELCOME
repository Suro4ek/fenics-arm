Welcome to FEniCS-git.

   exit

FEniCS itself is installed inside "/opt/fenics". Only changes in the home
directory "/home/fenics" is saved. This directory is synced to the host
"fenicshome" directory where the "fenics" script is found. In the typical
workflow, you edit your "myscript.py" with your favourite editor on the
host and then execute it inside this environment. Enjoy!
