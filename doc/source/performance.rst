.. Performance inside containers

Performance
===========

Running FEniCS in Docker may be faster than using a native build since
our Docker images have been tuned for performance, even when running
Docker using virtualisation technologies on Mac and Windows.

A range of FEniCS performance tests using containers can be found in

  Hale, J. S., Li, L., Richardson, C. N., and Wells, G. N. (2017).

  computing. *IEEE Computing in Science and Engineering* 19(6):40-50.
