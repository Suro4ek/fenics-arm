.. Performance inside containers

Performance
===========

Running FEniCS in Docker may be faster than using a native build since
our Docker images have been tuned for performance, even when running
Docker using virtualisation technologies on Mac and Windows.

A range of FEniCS performance tests using containers can be found in
<http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07573>.
