# FEniCS development environment image for Python 3

This image provides a development environment for building the FEniCS
libraries for Python 3. It does not provide an installation of
FEniCS. It is intended for users who want to build their own version
of FEniCS. It also serves as a base image for
<https://hub.docker.com/r/fenicsproject/dev-py3>, which does provide
the development version of FEniCS for Python 3.

We do provide a helper script in this container to compile FEniCS
automatically:

    update_fenics
