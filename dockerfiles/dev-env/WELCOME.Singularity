# FEniCS development environment image

Welcome to FEniCS/dev-env!

This image provides a full-featured and optimized build of all FEniCS
dependencies, but not FEniCS itself.

It is intended for developers or advanced users who want to build
their own version of FEniCS.

Here is an example of how to use this container with Singularity:

    export FENICS_SRC_DIR=$HOME/fenics/src
    export FENICS_PREFIX=$HOME/fenics
    fenics-pull
    fenics-build
    source /usr/local/share/fenics.env.conf
